🏥 Project Title:
Decentralized Health Visit Verification using IoT and Blockchain

🎯 Objective:
To build a tamper-proof, decentralized system that verifies community health worker (CHW) visits using IoT devices and blockchain technology, while ensuring data privacy, trust, and service quality through patient feedback, fraud detection, and analytics.

🧩 Problem Statement:
Community Health Workers (CHWs) are critical in rural and underserved regions, but the current system suffers from:

Fake or misreported visits.

No real-time verification of service delivery.

No audit trail for interventions.

Lack of patient trust.

Inability to measure service quality or detect fraud.

🔐 Proposed Solution:
Create a blockchain-based digital identity and verification system for CHWs, using IoT tools like QR/NFC, mobile apps for check-ins, ML models for fraud detection, and dashboards for visual insights.

🧱 Major Project Components
1. Mobile App for CHWs
CHWs log in using a digital ID (Ethereum wallet or DID).

Scan QR/NFC tag at patient's home.

Auto-captures GPS + timestamp.

Visit data is hashed and signed.

Sends signed payload to backend → pushed to blockchain.

Tech:

React Native or Flutter

Web3.js or ethers.js

NFC/QR plugin

Expo GPS or Geolocation API

2. Blockchain Backend
Stores:

Visit hash (patient + timestamp + CHW ID)

Signature (CHW digital signature)

Patient feedback hash (optional)

Immutable and tamper-proof.

Tech:

Solidity (Smart Contracts)

Polygon Mumbai / Ethereum Rinkeby

Infura/Alchemy

Hardhat for local development

3. Verification & Analytics Dashboard
Admin portal to:

View all visits by CHWs

See timestamps, GPS, patient ID

Check digital signature integrity

View heatmaps of coverage

See flagged fraudulent activity

Tech:

React + Chart.js / Mapbox GL JS

Express.js + Web3.js

MongoDB (for mirrored off-chain data for faster access)

Kepler.gl (heatmaps)

4. Patient Feedback Mechanism
After visit, patient gets an OTP or SMS link.

Opens feedback form (1–5 stars, comment).

Feedback is hashed (SHA-256) and stored on-chain.

Tech:

Firebase OTP API or Twilio SMS

Lightweight web app or PWA

Hashing: SHA-256 via Node.js

5. AI-Based Fraud Detection (Optional Module)
Train a lightweight model to detect patterns like:

More than 10 visits in an hour

CHWs logging visits from far GPS locations

Identical timestamps repeated

Tech:

Python + scikit-learn

Model trained on synthetic or anonymized real data

Simple dashboard to flag anomalies

6. IoT + Dynamic QR/NFC Tags
Dynamic QR Codes:

Expire every 5–10 minutes (time-based token)

Avoids photo misuse

NFC Tags:

Carry rotating keys

Secure physical proof of presence

Tech:

Node.js backend to generate rolling QR codes (e.g., using TOTP)

NFC tags readable via Android NFC scanner

🧪 Implementation Steps (MVP)

Phase 2: CHW App
Build app for scanning QR/NFC

Capture location + time

Sign with CHW private key

Submit to backend

Phase 3: Smart Contract
Deploy smart contract to testnet

Accept logs: visitHash, signature, CHW ID, feedback hash

Phase 4: Feedback System
OTP system to send feedback link to patient

Collect feedback, hash it, store on blockchain

Phase 5: Admin Dashboard
Pull blockchain data

Display in tabular format

Add maps and heatmaps (Kepler.gl or Mapbox)

Phase 6 (Optional): Fraud Detection
Simulate fake CHW patterns

Train a simple ML model

Flag suspicious logs on dashboard
